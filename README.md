## Features

1. **Dynamic Product Fetching**

   - Fetches a product list using a GET request from:
     ```
     https://gist.githubusercontent.com/sevindi/5765c5812bbc8238a38b3cf52f233651/raw/56261d81af8561bf0a7cf692fe572f9e1e91f372/products.json
     ```
   - Retrieves the product list from `localStorage` if available.

2. **Carousel Design**

   - Displays 6.5 products in the carousel at a time.
   - Smooth navigation for one product to the left or right with arrow buttons.

3. **Interactive Features**

   - Clicking the heart icon toggles favorite status:
     - **Unselected**: Displays a bordered heart.
     - **Selected**: Displays a **filled blue heart**.
   - Favorite preferences are stored in `localStorage` and retained after page refresh.

4. **Responsiveness**

   - Supports desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
   - Dynamically adjusts visible product count based on screen size.

5. **Customizable**
   - Developed using only **JavaScript** and **jQuery**.
